Welcome to Dirty Water, your number one site for reviewing public bathrooms in
the great city of Boston!

A number of technologies were used in creating this essential app, including
(but not limited to) Ember, Ruby on Rails, Handlebars and more!

My general approach to this app was to keep things as simple as possible.
The UI layout is minimal and the back-end consists of only one join table.
